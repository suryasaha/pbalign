**Q: Can pbalign handle large datasets with many movies?**

A: pbalign is not designed to handle large datasets, you should follow a [divide and conquer way](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbalign/wiki/Tutorial:-How-to-divide-and-conquer-large-datasets-using-pbalign) to align many movies to a reference.
